# scrubfu Roadmap

The scrubfu roadmap communicates project priorities for evolving and extending the scope of the product. New product experiences and features will include changes in various layers of the product.

The scrubfu team is currently focused on creating a data scrubbing and obfuscating utility. We encourage the community to work with us to improve scrubfu for these scenarios and extend it for others.

## Released Versions

## Upcoming Ship Dates

| Milestone                 | Release Date |

Note: Dates are calendar year (as opposed to fiscal year).

Milestone information is available on most repos, for example [milestones](https://github.com/Grindrodbank/scrubfu/milestones).

## Feedback

The best way to give feedback is to create issues in the [scrubfu](https://github.com/Grindrodbank/scrubfu) repo. 

Although mostly obvious, please give us feedback that will give us insight on the following points:

* Existing features are missing some capability or otherwise don't work well enough.
* Missing features that should be added to the product.
* Design choices for a feature that is currently in-progress.

Some important caveats / notes:

* It is best to give design feedback quickly for improvements that are in-development. We're unlikely to hold a feature being part of a release on late feedback.
* We are most likely to include improvements that either have a positive impact on a broad scenario or have very significant positive impact on a niche scenario. This means that we are unlikely to prioritize modest improvements to niche scenarios.
* Compatibility will almost always be given a higher priority than improvements.
